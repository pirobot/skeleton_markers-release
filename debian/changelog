ros-hydro-skeleton-markers (0.4.1-1raring) raring; urgency=high

  * Renamed skeleton_markers.py to markers_from_skeleton_msg.py since catkin cannot have a script with the same name as the package
  * Removed roslib import from Python nodes
  * Tweaked markers_from_tf.py to deal with user index suffix in frame names
  * Initial commit
  * Contributors: Patrick Goebel
